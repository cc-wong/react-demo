# React Demo
This project acts as a simple demo for React JS.

1. An API call is made to endpoint `/getSumoHonbashoSchedule` of the webservice from [Python Webservice Demo](https://github.com/cc-wong/python-webservice-demo). The year argument is provided by a dropdown field.
2. The JSON returned by the API call contains data on the Grand Sumo Tournament schedule for the specified year. This data is populated to the frontend.
